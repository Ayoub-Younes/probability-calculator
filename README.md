# Hat Drawing Probability Calculator

## Project Overview
The Hat Drawing Probability Calculator is a Python-based application designed to simulate random draws from a hat filled with different colored balls. It allows users to define the contents of the hat, specify how many balls they want to draw, and determine how often a desired outcome occurs after a series of experiments. This tool is useful for calculating probabilities based on repeated trials and expected outcomes, offering insight into basic probability principles through simulation.

## Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for implementing the hat drawing simulation and probability calculation.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The Hat class encapsulates the contents of the hat and the functionality for drawing balls, while the experiment function simulates multiple draws.
Random Module: Used to ensure random selection of balls during the drawing process.
List Manipulation: Employed to dynamically manage the contents of the hat and simulate drawing balls.
